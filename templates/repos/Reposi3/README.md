# Reposi3
A Cydia repository template. This template contains sample on how you can easily make depiction pages without replicating your html pages. The pages are styled using [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) which is really easy to use. You can see how it looks like by visiting [this sample repo](https://supermamon.github.io/Reposi3/) on your desktop or mobile phone.

Most data for this repo is stored on XML files and are loaded on the depiction page dynamically. See the guide below on how to set it up. Note that this guide doesn't cover creating .deb files but will briefly cover assiging depictions.

## How to use this template

### 1. Download

If you are *not* hosting your repo on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), you can download the zip file [here](https://github.com/supermamon/Reposi3/archive/master.zip) and extract to a subfolder on your website.

There are 2 options for those using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

A. If you want to use your root `username.github.io` as your repo, fork this repo and rename it to `username.github.io`. So when adding it in Cydia, use `https://username.github.io`.

B. If you want to use a subfolder for your existing `username.github.io` as your repo (example `username.github.io/repo`), fork this repo and rename it to `repo`. So when adding it in Cydia, use `https://username.github.io/repo`.

You can change `repo` to anything you want, like `cydia` for example. So your repo url would be `https://username.github.io/cydia`.


#### 2. Personalize

**Release File**

Edit `Release` file. Modify the items pointed by `<--`

* Replace CydiaIcon.png.


**Page Footers**

This data are the links that appear at the bottom of every depication. The data is stored in `repo.xml` at the root folder of your repo.

```xml

        <link>
            <name>Follow me on Twitter</name>
            <url>https://twitter.com/reposi3</url>
            <iconclass>glyphicon glyphicon-user</iconclass>

        </link>
    </footerlinks>
</repo>
```


#### 3. Your repo is _almost_ ready.
At this point your repo is basically ready to be added into Cydia.
You can also visit your repo's homepage by going to `https://username.github.io/repo/`.
It will come with 2 sample packages, Old Package and New Package.
Each of the packages have a link on this page pointing to their depictions.
Next guide will show you how to assign and customize your depiction pages.

## Adding packages first package to your repo

#### 1. Adding a simple depiction page

Go to the depictions folder and duplicate the folder `com.supermamon.oldpackage`.
Rename the duplicate with the same name as your package name.
There are 2 files inside the folder - `info.xml` and `changelog.xml`.
Update the 2 files with information regading your package.
The tags are pretty much self-explanatory.
Contact [@reposi3](https://twitter.com/reposi3) or [@supermamon](https://twitter.com/supermamon) for questions.

`info.xml`.
```xml
<package>
    <id>com.supermamon.oldpackage</id>
    <name>Old Package</name>
    <version>1.0.0-1</version>
    <compatibility>
        <firmware>
            <miniOS>5.0</miniOS>
            <maxiOS>7.0</maxiOS>
            <otherVersions>unsupported</otherVersions>
            <!--
            for otherVersions, you can put either unsupported or unconfirmed
            -->
        </firmware>
    </compatibility>
    <dependencies></dependencies>
    <descriptionlist>
        <description>This is an old package. Requires iOS 7 and below..</description>
    </descriptionlist>
    <screenshots></screenshots>
    <changelog>
        <change>Initial release</change>
    </changelog>
    <links></links>
</package>
```

`changelog.xml`.
```xml
<changelog>
    <changes>
        <version>1.0.0-1</version>
        <change>Initial release</change>
    </changes>
</changelog>
```


#### 2. Link the depiction page your tweak's `control` file

You can add the depictions url at the end of your package's `control` file before compiling it.
The depiction line should look like this:

```text
Depiction: https://username.github.io/repo/depictions/?p=[idhere]
```

Replace `[idhere]` with your actual package name.

```text
Depiction: https://username.github.io/repo/depictions/?p=com.supermamon.oldpackage
```

#### 3. Rebuilding the `Packages` file

With your updated `control` file, build your tweak.
Store the resulting `.deb.` file into the `/debs/` folder of your repo.
Build your `Packages` file and compress with `bzip2`.

```sh
user:~/ $ cd repo
user:~/repo $ dpkg-scanpackages -m ./debs > Packages
user:~/repo $ bzip2 Packages
```

_Windows users, see [dpkg-scanpackages-py](https://github.com/supermamon/dpkg-scanpackages-py) or [scanpkg](https://github.com/mstg/scanpkg)._

#### 5. Cydia at last!

If you haven't done yet, go ahead and add your repo to Cydia.
You should now be able to install your tweak into your own repo.

### Cleanup

Just a cleanup step, remove the debs that came with this template and re-run the commands on step 3. You can keep the sample depictions for reference by they're not needed for your repo.
