# Sileo Native Depiction Generator
**Sileo Native Depiction Generator** is used to create native depiction files to use for the Sileo application on your repo. The script uses a JSON file with placeholder text inside and when the script runs it creates a copy of that file and replaces the placeholder text with information that the users enters.
